\title{Gives the inconsistencies between activity sea surface temperature and valid threshold}
\usage{
logbook_temperature_control(dataframe1, output, threshold = c(15, 32))
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe1}{{\link[base]{data.frame}} expected. Csv or output of the function {\link[furdeb]{data_extraction}}, which must be done before using the logbook_temperature_control () function.}

\item{output}{{\link[base]{character}} expected. Kind of expected output. You can choose between "message", "report" or "logical".}

\item{threshold}{{\link[base]{numeric}} expected. Default values: 15 and 32. Vector containing the lower and upper acceptable threshold for sea surface temperature.}
}
\value{
The function returns a {\link[base]{character}} with output is "message", a {\link[base]{data.frame}} with output is "report", a {\link[base]{logical}} with output is "logical"
}
\description{
The purpose of the logbook_temperature_control function is to provide a table of data that contains an inconsistency between the sea surface temperature for the activity and valid threshold
}
\details{
The input dataframe must contain all these columns for the function to work :
\itemize{
Dataframe 1:
\item{\code{  activity_id}}
\item{\code{  activity_seasurfacetemperature}}
}
}
\examples{
#Activity 1 is ok,
#Activity 2 and 3 have temperatures outside the thresholds
dataframe1 <- data.frame(activity_id = c("1", "2", "3"),
                         activity_seasurfacetemperature = c(20, 4, 35))
logbook_temperature_control(dataframe1, output = "report")
}
